My team and I created this project for the Kibur Hackathon 2022. The app's concept revolves around a simple E-Learning platform that teaches 
users basic technology skills. We won third place with this app concept. The repository only contains the prototype, which lacks a backend. 
Despite that, the UI looks impressive, and I am proud of implementing it using XML. Without further ado, here is the prototype.
